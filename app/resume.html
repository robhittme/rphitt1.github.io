			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				I recently graduated from College of Charleston with degrees in Political Science and Philosophy.  I didn’t want to go work in D.C. and was definitely not going to Law school.  I wanted to pursue a career in video journalism.  And that is exactly what I did.  But as time pressed on, I saw started to expand my horizons of what I really wanted out of video journalism.  I wanted to create and capture something that I could give to others.  I started to see video, journalism, and digital media blurring.  I learned of the Iron Yard Academy and signed up as quickly as I could.  I never imagined falling in love with programming as much as I have.  It gives me the ability to create and provide.  Pretty rewarding stuff.  I am excited to make a career out of programming and see where it will take me.  I am willing to go the distance.

			<h1>Previous Work Experience</h1>
			<p>
				Before diving head first into the world of front end engineering I was pursuing a career in videography and video journalism.  I worked on a few sets and projects while making some of my own.  It gave me experience with self-discipline and working long hours in a fast paced environment to get a project completed.

			<h4>Brad Jayne & Company</h4>
			<div>May 2013</div>	
			<a href="http://www.bradjayne.com">www.bradjayne.com</a>
			<p>
				I had the pleasure of working with Brad Jayne on his first independent film ‘Warrior Road’ as a production assistant.  Most days were spent making coffee runs and getting whatever was need.  I got to drive around a Cutless for arial shots for a day.  That was pretty great. 
			</p>
			<h4>Tierra Unida Films</h4>
			<div>Summer & Fall 2012</div>	
			<a href="http://www.Tierraunidafilms.org">www.tierraundiafilms.com</a>
			<p>
				I worked with director Tom Laffay on a few projects as a camera and audio assistant
				-“America Street” documentary about food access on America Street
				-Office of Sustainability short about the office’s collective efforts to
				     create a more sustainable campus

			<h4>Duvall Catering</h4>

			<p>
				I had to stay alive somehow while breaking into the video industry.  I worked most of my weekends at weddings and banquets.  I learned fine dining quickly and still instinctively place my silverware and glasses accordingly.
			</p>
			<h1>Education</h1>
			<h4>The Iron Yard Academy</h4>
			<div>April 2014 to June 2014</div>	
			<p>
				The Iron Yard Academy is a 12-week bootcamp for front end engineering I attended in Charleston, SC under the wing of the one and only Calvin Webster.
			</p>
			<h4>College of Charleston</h4>
			<div>August 2009 to May 2013</div>	
			<p>
				I earned degrees in Political Science & Philosophy.  In Political Science I took and interest in a focus on technology and consciousness in philosophy.  Dangerous combo.  I'm still recovering.
