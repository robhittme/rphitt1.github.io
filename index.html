Hitt and I am a front end web developer. I have always had a love for working with others to achieve great things and web development allows me to do just that. Through my education and various experiences, I have found the thing I enjoy most is working with others to solve problems that enrich lives. I recently graduated from the <a href=http://www.theironyard.com/education target=_blank>Iron Yard</a>, an intensive three month coding bootcamp that takes you from zero to front end engineer. Not only did the Iron Yard teach me how to build web applications from the ground up, but how to think like an engineer and tackle any problems that I encounter. I have the confidence to overcome any problem that comes my way. Working with the amazing staff and students at the Iron Yard, I have developed a passion for life-long learning, the art of coding, and being a part of this great community. If you want to check out my <a href=http://rphitt1.github.io/resume>resume</a> see some of the awesome stuff I can do.</p></div><div class=secondPic><h3>I look forward to opportunities that allow me to work on awesome projects with awesome people.</h3></div><div class=flex-container><div class=projects id=projectsSection><h2>Projects</h2><div class=project><a href=https://focalapp.firebaseapp.com><img src=../images/738e2025.focal.png alt=""></a><p class=description>Focal was my final project at The Iron Yard.

                            Pick Me Up was an app I made with two other classmates.  We wanted to create an application that could calculate your awareness level and preparedness for the grueling Iron Yard days.  We used Underscore.js, constructors, and its full tested with Chai and Mocha. I was a regular user.

                            Photoflip is a photo album built with jQuery.  I transversed the DOM like a ninja to give a smooth user experience.  Its fun for the siblings, children and parent elements.
