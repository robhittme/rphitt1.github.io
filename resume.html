I wanted to pursue a career in video journalism. And that is exactly what I did. But as time pressed on, I saw started to expand my horizons of what I really wanted out of video journalism. I wanted to create and capture something that I could give to others. I started to see video, journalism, and digital media blurring. I learned of the Iron Yard Academy and signed up as quickly as I could. I never imagined falling in love with programming as much as I have. It gives me the ability to create and provide. Pretty rewarding stuff. I am excited to make a career out of programming and see where it will take me. I am willing to go the distance.</p></section><section><h1>Skills</h1><p>I have learned everything from the ground up.

It was a face paced environment that demanded speed and detail-oriented execution.</p></section></div></div>
